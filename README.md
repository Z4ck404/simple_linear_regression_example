applying linear regressio to predict energy consumption
The database in our case and a csv file containing five records of internal and external thermal condition sensors in a production building of a company and the daily energy consumption of the latter in the different situations (captured conditions).
##The variables (features & label):
The explanatory variables in our case are the different xi (i = 1,2, ..., 5) which represents the climatic and thermal conditions inside and outside the building.
And the variable to predict is the energy consumption of the company for each record.
